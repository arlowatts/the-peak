## Meeting 1

Attendance: Amir, Raph, Artin, Kieran, Arlo

Location: virtual

Date: 2024-02-07

It was suggested that, to determine the core game concept for the project, each member should first share their board game ideation from the earlier solo ideation assignment. Then, each member would cast a vote for three ideas they preferred. After initial voting concluded, there would be the possibility of additional discussion that could change the final decision. All group members agreed to this procedure.

Following the above idea selection process, each member shared their board game concept with the group. Once all ideas had been shared, each member considered their preference and cast three votes for three different concepts. The game concept that received the most votes after the initial voting process was The Peak, a card-based mountain climbing game. Further discussion will continue in subsequent meetings.

To conclude the meeting, we discussed next steps for the development of the game. We agreed that this process should involve consideration of the physical representation of the game; possible changes to the gameplay mechanics; and future playtesting to refine the game. In our next meeting, we will finalise the core idea and mechanics and begin planning the development of the game.

## Meeting 2

Attendance: Amir, Raph, Artin, Arlo

Location: virtual

Date: 2024-02-14

The final form of the board game was discussed. Comparing two main options, a physical board game or a digital board game, we decided to make a physical board game.

We discussed and created a core statement for the game. We also discussed and created three pillar statements answering the "what", "how", and "why" questions.

Following the core and pillar statements, we talked about the specific game elements and how they contribute to the gameplay. We considered different types of cards, such as Mountain, Weather, and Tool cards, and generated ideas of ways to integrate them into the gameplay. We also briefly discussed the other game components, including dice, the board, and the player pieces.

Finally we assigned each member of the group to one or more tasks to work on until the next meeting.

## Meeting 3

Attendance: Raph, Artin, Arlo, Kieran

Location: virtual

Date: 2024-02-28

Each member attending the meeting gave a progress update regarding their tasks from the last meeting. The thematic background portion was further discussed and the group agreed to include, in the thematic background, the idea that the mountaineer in the game is a student on their way to class atop Burnaby Mountain.

Following the thematic background, the group discussed the implementation of the game. For the rest of the meeting, the group collaborated on the first drafts of the decks of Mountain and Goal cards, including all main components of the card design.

## Meeting 4

Attendance: Raph, Arlo, Amir

Location: SFU Burnaby Campus

Date: 2024-03-12

Today we met up in person for the first time to finalize making the board game and all the visual prospects. We worked together using AI and editing the cards and board, finalizing the design of the game. Got to print some of the cards on paper and put them in card sleeves along with actual cards to give them the card feel. Discussed our next plan of action, which was to print the board and the rest of the cards, so we can start playtesting and creating a video regarding the game.

Also finished up the flowchart, consisting of 3, one each for the mountaineer and mountain players, and another one for the core loop of the game.

## Meeting 5

Attendance: Raph, Arlo, Amir, Kieran, Artin

Location: SFU Burnaby Campus

Date: 2024-03-20

Today we printed all the cards and the board. The cards are all now sleeved and the board is glued onto poster board, so everything is playable. We were able to playtest and implicate any game changes needed.

## Meeting 6

Attendance: Arlo, Artin, Kieran

Location: SFU Burnaby Campus

Date: 2024-03-22

Today we met up in person to finalize play testing and edit some of the visual components. We completed the playtesting and balanced parts of the game we felt were too powerful. Discussed our final plan of action, which was to create and edit the video and make sure the board game is fully uploaded to our website.
