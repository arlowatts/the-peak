At the peak of Burnaby Mountain stands the esteemed Simon Fraser University, towering over the lower mainland. The passage to the top is treacherous, as students must overcome various obstacles protruding from the mountain. You are among these dedicated academics with a passion for education!

However, in this asymmetrical board game, the journey to class is not a simple stroll down the street. Each day is an embarkment up vigorous trails and unpredictable environmental destructions to congest your path to knowledge. At every step, you must use your intellect, agility, and resilience to take advantage and stay ahead of the game. Do you have what it takes to tame the mountain and reach the lecture hall of boundless learning?

## Core Statement and Pillars

The Peak is a strategic two-player mountain-climbing game, where one player aims to ascend to the summit while the other player, controlling the mountain, seeks to hinder their progress with treacherous obstacles.

### What

The Peak is a competitive board game where one player assumes the role of a mountaineer striving to conquer a mountain while the other player acts as the mountain itself.

### How

The mountain player strategically places obstacles and cards to impede the mountaineer's progress as each player works to achieve their respective objectives.

### Why

The mountaineer aims to conquer the mountain and meet their personal goals while the mountain works to preserve its untamed nature.

## Context and Inspiration

The Peak was inspired by SFU’s Burnaby campus and its unusual location atop a mountain, which led to the idea of a mountain-climbing game.

One of the primary features of the game is its asymmetry between players. This was not directly influenced by any individual game, but the concept of Goal cards was inspired by a similar mechanic in the game Wingspan. Goal cards give different players different ways to gain points, allowing each player to interact with the game in a slightly different way. The Peak expands this idea, completely separating each player’s goals. This makes the game less directly oppositional, as players are not necessarily fighting for the same resources, but maintains the game’s competitive nature.

Another quality of the game is the lack of a printed game board, instead using a dynamic state based on cards. Many existing games apply a similar mechanic, including Wingspan, Unearth, and Boss Monster. Like The Peak, these games put cards on the table as the game’s board and might place tokens on them or look at their physical positions relative to each other. This mechanic makes these games more dynamic and replayable because the decisions each player makes are completely different each game.
