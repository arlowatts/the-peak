The Peak is a strategic two-player mountain-climbing game, where one player aims to ascend to the summit while the other player, controlling the mountain, seeks to hinder their progress with treacherous obstacles.

The game is played with two decks of cards: Goal cards, which determine each player's secret objectives in the game, and Mountain cards, which represent the mountain the mountaineer must climb. The Mountain player will arrange Mountain cards on the board to hinder the mountaineer’s progress. The Mountaineer player will navigate them to find the best path to victory.

## Game Elements

### Mountain Player

Before the game starts, one player is chosen as the Mountain player. This player will draw Mountain cards directly from the deck and arrange them on the board to obstruct the Mountaineer player.

### Mountaineer Player

The other player in the game is the Mountaineer player. This player will roll dice to challenge obstacles on the board, gaining points and special powers for each one crossed.

### Goal Cards

At the start of the game, each player draws two Goal cards. At the end of the game, each player reveals their Goal cards and gains extra points if they have completed the goal printed on them. Each Goal card can be used by either player, so both players draw from the same deck of Goal cards.

### Mountain Cards

The main component of the game is the deck of Mountain cards. Each Mountain card has two numbers printed on it: Elevation and Difficulty. A card can also have additional effects when it is played, when the mountaineer crosses it, or when the mountaineer tries to cross it and fails.

#### Elevation

A Mountain card’s Elevation does not initially impact the board. At the end of the game, the Mountaineer gains a number of points equal to the total Elevation they gained from the Mountain cards they crossed. Also at the end of the game, the Mountain player gains a number of points equal to the total Elevation among the Mountain cards still on the board. Many Goal cards also consider the Elevation of the cards the Mountaineer has crossed.

#### Difficulty

A Mountain card’s Difficulty represents how challenging it is for the Mountaineer to climb it. During the Mountaineer’s turn, they can attempt to climb Mountain cards by rolling two six-sided dice and comparing the result to the card’s Difficulty. If they match or beat the card’s Difficulty, they succeed and remove the card from the board. Otherwise, they fail and must return to the spot they were on before, leaving the card on the board.

#### Special Effect

A Mountain card’s special effect is an effect that occurs either when the Mountain player plays a Mountain card, when the Mountaineer fails to cross it, or when the Mountaineer successfully crosses it. Some cards also have continuous effects that apply as long as they are on the board. The text printed on the card describes when the effect can happen and how long it lasts. The effect can range from subtracting an amount from the Mountaineer’s next die roll to moving all the cards around on the board. Not all Mountain cards have effects, and some have several!

Some Mountain Cards have no Elevation or Difficulty and only have an immediate effect. These cards can be played by the Mountain player and don’t need to be played onto the board - they are discarded immediately.

### Other Components

#### Dice

The game uses two six-sided dice. The Mountaineer rolls them on their turn to overcome obstacles. Mountain cards might also instruct players to roll dice.

#### Mountaineer Token

The Mountaineer uses the Mountaineer token to track their position on the game board. The Mountain player does not need a token because they do not have a specific position on the board.

#### Board

The board is a 5x5 grid of cells each the size of a Mountain card. The Mountain player places Mountain cards on the board and the Mountaineer moves between adjacent cards.

## Playing the Game

### Setup

Decide who will be the Mountain player and who will be the Mountaineer player. Place the board in the middle of the table and put the Mountaineer Token in the center square. Shuffle both decks of cards and place them near the board. Make room for a discard pile next to the deck of Mountain cards. Then the Mountain player draws two Goal cards and five Mountain cards, and the Mountaineer player draws two Goal cards. The Mountain player will take the first turn.

### The Mountain Player’s Turn

At the start of the Mountain player’s turn, they draw Mountain cards from the deck until they have five Mountain cards in their hand. Then they can play any number of Mountain cards from their hand into unoccupied spaces on the board. A space on the board is occupied if it contains either the Mountaineer token or a Mountain card. While the Mountain player is playing Mountain cards, there may be card effects. These happen right away before they play any more cards.

The Mountain player must also make sure that, by the end of their turn, every occupied space on the board is next to at least two other occupied spaces. This means that every Mountain card needs to be next to at least two other Mountain cards or next to at least one other Mountain card and the Mountaineer token. The Mountaineer token also needs to be next to at least two Mountain cards. If this is not possible, then at least the Mountaineer token must be next to at least two Mountain cards.

When the Mountain player has no more cards to play or doesn’t want to play any more cards, their turn ends and it becomes the Mountaineer player’s turn.

### The Mountaineer Player’s Turn

During their turn, the Mountaineer player can choose a Mountain card in a square next to the Mountaineer token on the board and try to challenge it. To challenge a Mountain card, the Mountaineer player rolls two six-sided dice and adds them together. Then they compare the result to the Difficulty value of the Mountain card they chose.

If the result of the dice is equal to or greater than the Difficulty value, they succeed. The Mountaineer player takes the card off the board and moves the Mountaineer token into the space it previously occupied. They’ll keep the card until the end of the game and will gain points for its Elevation. If the Mountain card has a special effect when it is successfully crossed, that effect happens immediately. Then the Mountaineer player continues their turn and may try to challenge more Mountain cards in the same way, or may choose to end their turn.

If the result of the dice is less than the Difficulty of the Mountain card, the mountaineer fails. The card stays where it is on the board and the Mountaineer player’s turn ends. If the card has an effect when the Mountaineer player fails to cross it, that effect happens.

## Ending the Game

When both players finish 5 turns each, the game ends. To determine the winner, each player reveals their Goal cards. For each player, add up the points they gain from each of their Goal cards. The Mountaineer player gains additional points equal to the total Elevation they gained from the Mountain cards they crossed. Then the Mountain player obtains points equal to the total elevation of any remaining Mountain cards left on the board. The player with the most points wins!
