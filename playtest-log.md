At the first playthroughs of the initial iteration of the game, the win rate of the mountain player and the mountaineer were fairly equal, with the mountaineer having a slight edge. The win condition for the mountaineer is one lucky turn, if the mountaineer manages to fully clear the board early and acquire some of the extra roll cards(Bear cave, Stream, etc.) they are set for a fairly easy win. The dominant strategy for the mountain is pathing the mountaineer into traps, by surrounding the mountaineer with high difficulty cards while having one easy to clear card, you can influence the mountaineer to take a certain path into cards that might be advantageous to you, for example forcing the mountaineer to cross a gondola in the late game getting rid of alot of points or having to challenge a high difficulty card and risk a likely failure.

During the very initial play test on March 20, all the cards functionality as well as the core loop and flowcharts were tested checking for functionality of the game. During this time the mountaineer was dominantly winning every game by a large margin. During the next playtest on March 22, rules were tweaked and changed to allow the mountain to gain more points, closing the gap between the two players greatly. Moreover the number of the turns for the game were limited to induce variability to the games having some cards left out and keeping games different from playing until all cards are used. Some strategies were identified for both players, for the mountaineer: choosing to skip turns strategically and/or attempting a card with the goal to fail for an advantage(Tectonic plate). For the mountain: the pathing of the mountaineer, leaving only one path if the board allows that will give the mountain an advantage if the path is crossed, whilst leaving an out for the mountaineer if they are lucky. As well as extending the board outwards to leverage the cards remaining rule and make it harder for the mountain player to fully clear a board, making blockades of high difficulty cards to protect high elevation cards away from the mountaineer.

Over all the game became more balanced with tweaking of points and rules to even out the gap between the two players and now hangs in the hands of two things: the dice rolls and card placements. Through games the deck was constantly being used down to the last 5-6 cards. When the mountaineer won it was mainly a mix of high dice rolls and correct path choices, while the mountain relied on strategic placement more than actual dice luck, by playing high difficulty cards correctly the mountain main weapon was probability while the mountaineer relied a lot more on luck.
